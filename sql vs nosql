The key differences between SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) databases are as follows:

1. Data Model:
   SQL: Uses a relational data model where data is stored in tables with predefined schemas. Tables are structured with rows and columns, and relationships between tables are established using primary and foreign keys.
   NoSQL: Uses various non-relational data models, including document, key-value, column-family, and graph models. Thereâ€™s more flexibility with how data is stored, and schema can be dynamic.

2. Schema:
   SQL: Requires a fixed schema. The table structure must be defined before inserting data. Any changes in the schema, such as adding or removing columns, require altering the table.
   NoSQL: Typically schema-less or has a flexible schema. Documents in the same collection (in document databases) can have different structures, allowing for more dynamic data storage.

3. Scalability:
   SQL: Vertically scalable. To handle more load, you generally need to upgrade the hardware of a single server (more CPU, RAM, etc.). Scaling across multiple servers (horizontal scaling) is possible but complex.
   NoSQL: Horizontally scalable. It is easier to scale across multiple servers, making it a good fit for large, distributed systems.

4. Transactions and ACID Compliance:
   SQL: Strong support for ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions. This ensures reliability in systems that require strict consistency and where data integrity is critical (e.g., financial systems).
   NoSQL: Generally, it has looser ACID compliance. NoSQL databases often focus on BASE (Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency), which allows for better performance and scalability at the cost of consistency.

5. Query Language:
   SQL: Uses SQL, a powerful and standardized query language to interact with relational databases. SQL is declarative, meaning users specify *what* they want (e.g., `SELECT`, `JOIN`, etc.).
   NoSQL: No standard query language. Querying depends on the specific database type (e.g., MongoDB uses a JSON-like query syntax). NoSQL queries tend to be more flexible but less standardized than SQL.

6. Data Integrity and Relationships:
   SQL: Strongly supports data integrity with constraints, foreign keys, and joins to maintain complex relationships between tables. Ideal for structured data that requires relationships between entities.
   NoSQL: Typically does not support joins or complex relationships natively. Data is often denormalized (redundant copies) to improve read performance, but this comes at the cost of complexity in maintaining relationships and consistency.

7. Performance:
   SQL: Better suited for complex queries, multi-table joins, and applications requiring strong consistency. It may have performance limitations with massive amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data.
   NoSQL: Designed for high-performance operations on large datasets, especially for applications that require quick reads/writes, and where data structure flexibility is important.

8. Use Cases:
   SQL: Best for traditional OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) systems such as banking, accounting, and enterprise systems, where data structure and consistency are critical.
   NoSQL: Ideal for use cases like real-time web applications, big data, social networks, content management systems, and applications with rapidly evolving or unstructured data models.

9. Examples:
   SQL Databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle Database.
   NoSQL Databases: MongoDB (document), Cassandra (wide-column), Redis (key-value), Neo4j (graph).
